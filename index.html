        My name is <strong>Babalola Moyinoluwa</strong>,a 300 level Dental student of the University of Ibadan,
        a web designer and developer. From my experience people tends to underrate this course into <strong>'just teeth'</strong>
        I once told someone that i'm studying dentistry and the person was like <strong>'how many people do experience tooth ache?'
    </strong> that is what pushed me to create awareness on common misconceptions and debunk it

    <h3 class="items">WHAT IS DENTISTRY?</h3>
    <p>
        Dentistry is a branch of healthcare that focuses on the prevention,
        diagnosis, and treatment of diseases related to the teeth, gums,
        and mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oral health is important to overall health because problems in the mouth
        can affect the rest of the body, including digestion, speech, and even
        heart health.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of this project is to educate the public about dentistry
        and correct common false beliefs and misconceptions about dentists
        and dental care.
    </p>
    <p>
        A dentist is a trained healthcare professional who diagnoses, treats,
        and prevents oral diseases and helps patients maintain healthy smiles.

        COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT DENTIST
    </h1>
    <img src="./WhatsApp Image 2025-12-28 at 9.35.27 PM.jpeg" alt="image">
  
    <p>One of the major reasons that inspired me to undertake this project is the widespread <strong>underrating of dentistry</strong> as a university course. Many people wrongly assume that dentistry is not lucrative or significant,or rather inferior to mbbs, often basing their opinions on misconceptions rather than facts.

I vividly recall the moment I informed my parents of my intention to study dentistry. Their immediate reaction was shaped by common beliefs such as the frequent occurrence of toothaches and the assumption that dental problems are not too common or insignificant to make dentistry a rewarding profession. These perceptions reflect the numerous fallacies and misunderstandings surrounding dentistry.

It is because of these misconceptions that I decided to create this project. The aim is to educate the public, correct false beliefs, and highlight the true value of dentistry as a vital healthcare profession and an important field of study. Through this project, I hope to promote better understanding and appreciation of dentistry and its role in improving overall health and quality of life.</p>

<h3>MYTHS VS FACT</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1.<strong>MYTH</strong>:Dentistry is easier than Medicine</li>
<li><strong>FACT</strong>:Dentistry is a rigorous and demanding course that requires in-depth knowledge of medical sciences and intense clinical training while taking all their(mbbs) courses before enrolling to the dental school (obviously an ADVANTAGE)</li>

<p><li>2.<strong>MYTH</strong>:Dentistry is only about teeth.</li>
<li><strong>FACT</strong>:Dentistry covers the teeth, gums, jaws, facial muscles, nerves, and diseases of the oral and maxillofacial region.</li></p>

<p><li>3.<strong>MYTH</strong>:Dentistry has limited career opportunities</li>
<li><strong>FACT</strong>:Dentists can specialize, teach, do research, work in public health,own a private hospital/clinic, hospitals, NGOs, or run private practices.</li></p>

<p><li>4.<strong>MYTH</strong>:Dentistry is not as prestigious as Medicine.</li>
<li><strong>FACT</strong>:Dentistry is a globally recognized and respected healthcare profession essential to overall health,have more time for themselves and earn way more than medicine </li></p>

<p><li>5.<strong>MYTH</strong>:Dentists do not perform surgeries.</li>
<li><strong>FACT</strong>:Dentistry includes oral and maxillofacial surgery, such as tooth extractions, minor surgeries, and jaw-related procedures.</li></p>

<p><li>6.<strong>MYTH</strong>:Brushing alone is enough to keep teeth healthy</li>
<li><strong>FACT</strong>:Brushing is important, but it is not enough. Flossing, mouthwash, and professional cleaning are also necessary for complete oral care.</li></p>

<p><li>7.<strong>MYTH</strong>:You only need to see a dentist when you feel pain</li>
<li><strong>FACT</strong>:Many dental problems do not cause pain at early stages. Regular checkups help detect and prevent serious issues before they become painful.</li>

<li>8.<strong>MYTH</strong>:Dentistry is not financially rewarding</li>
<li><strong>FACT</strong>:Dentistry can be highly lucrative, especially for dentists who run successful private practices or specialize in fields like orthodontics, oral surgery, or prosthodontics.</li>

<li>9.<strong>MYTH</strong>:Dentists have fewer opportunities for international practice</li>
<li><strong>FACT</strong>:Dentistry is a globally recognized profession with standardized training pathways in many countries. Dentists can practice internationally after meeting licensing requirements, just like MBBS doctors, and in some countries the transition for dentists is even more structured.</li>

<li>10.<strong>MYTH</strong>:Dentistry limits professional growth</li>
<li><strong>FACT</strong>:Dentistry offers continuous professional growth through advanced specializations, new technologies (implants, digital dentistry, cosmetic procedures), research, teaching, and entrepreneurship. Career progression in dentistry can be just as dynamic as in medicine.</li>

    <p>In conclusion, this project highlights the importance of dentistry not only as a vital healthcare profession but also as a respected and rewarding course of study. Through addressing common and lesser-known misconceptions, particularly those related to career value and financial prospects, it becomes clear that dentistry is often misunderstood and unfairly underestimated. Dentistry plays a crucial role in promoting oral and overall health, offering diverse career opportunities, professional growth, and meaningful impact on society. By correcting these false beliefs, this project aims to encourage informed decision-making, foster appreciation for the profession, and inspire a more positive perception of dentistry among students, parents, and the general public.</p>
